            <p>The annual Harvest Festival at St. Matthew's Community Church brought together over 200 congregation members and neighbors for an evening of fellowship, gratitude, and celebration. Families gathered in the decorated fellowship hall, adorned with pumpkins, corn stalks, and colorful autumn leaves, to share a potluck dinner featuring homemade casseroles, fresh bread, and seasonal desserts. The evening included live acoustic music from the church youth group, a blessing ceremony for the local food bank donations collected throughout the month, and storytelling from elder members about the community's history and God's faithfulness through the seasons. Children participated in a special craft corner making thankfulness cards for homebound church members, while adults enjoyed meaningful conversations and strengthened bonds that extend far beyond Sunday morning services.</p>
