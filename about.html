      <h2>History</h2>
      <p>
        Faith Unity Conference began in 2008 as a small prayer gathering of 30
        believers in our local community center. What started as a weekend
        retreat for spiritual renewal has grown into an annual conference that
        draws thousands of participants from across the region and beyond.

      <p>
        Over the years, our conference has expanded to include powerful worship
        sessions, transformative teaching seminars, mission outreach programs,
        and community service projects. We've witnessed countless testimonies of
        healing, restoration, and spiritual breakthrough.

        By 2020, we adapted to reach even more hearts through livestreamed
        services and virtual prayer groups, connecting believers worldwide.
        Today, Faith Unity Conference continues to be a beacon of hope and
        spiritual transformation in our community.
